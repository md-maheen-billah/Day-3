# Day 3 (Duration: 6 Months)
Today's learning encompassed the understanding of Version Control Systems (VCS), their significance, and the different types of VCS available. Subsequently, I delved into the specifics of Git, a distributed VCS, followed by an exploration of GitHub, including a comparison with Git. The session also covered hosting on GitHub and an introduction to various commands associated with the platform.
